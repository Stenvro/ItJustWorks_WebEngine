# Audio

How the game's sounds play in the browser (`src/audio/`). Files: [formats/audio.md](formats/audio.md);
records: [formats/esm.md](formats/esm.md#sounds).

## Loading

Sound files are read through the VFS on the main thread and decoded in the audio worker
(`src/workers/audio-worker.ts`): WAV directly, xWMA (music, voices) with ffmpeg.wasm, which
loads on the first xWMA file (~0.5 s with the main theme). A descriptor's file is found as the
engine finds it (its name, else the other extension). Decoded files are kept as Web Audio
buffers up to 256 MB, least recently used first out (a playing sound keeps its buffer).

Browsers start audio only after a user gesture: the first click or key resumes the audio
context.

## The graph

- **Categories** (SNCT): one gain per category, connected as the categories' tree to the
  master: a category plays at its own volume × its parents' (`_AudioCategoryMaster` 0.9 ×
  SFX 0.9 × ...) × the user's slider for categories that have one (the slider's default,
  UNAM, until the settings menu: TODO(M9)).
- **A sound** (`sound-instance.ts`): a buffer source at the descriptor's pitch (frequency
  shift ± a random variation, percent), a gain for its static attenuation and a random cut of
  up to its dB variance, a gain for the output model's distance curve, then a 3D panner (HRTF;
  output models that use HRTF) or fixed speaker levels (output models with defined speaker
  output: the mono / stereo-left / stereo-right rows onto left and right, centre at −3 dB to
  both, rear speakers to their side; no surround output yet), into its category. Its output
  model's reverb send goes to the reverb bus (at its category's volume).
- **Distance:** the panner only pans; the volume follows the output model's curve
  ([esm.md](formats/esm.md#sounds)), smoothed over 50 ms. Output models without distance
  attenuation play at full volume wherever they play.
- **Looping** (descriptor LNAM): loop plays the file's loop region (WAV `smpl`, else the whole
  file) until stopped; envelope fast and slow also play the part before the loop once (attack)
  and, when stopped, the part after it (release): fast jumps there at once, slow finishes the
  loop's pass first. Sounds stopped because their cell unloads stop at once.
- **The listener** is at the camera, facing along it, Z up.

## Placed sounds

The loaded cells' sound markers (SOUN) and the looping sounds of activators, moveable
statics, talking activators, lights (torches crackle) and doors (CellSoundEmitter) play while
the listener is within their output model's maximum distance (and stop 10 % beyond it, so
they do not flicker at the edge); those without distance attenuation play while their cell is
loaded. Doors and containers play their open and close sounds when used; load doors their
open sound as the player goes through.

## Acoustic spaces

Interiors have one (cell XCAS); in exteriors placed acoustic spaces (ASPC references) take
effect inside their box. The space in effect gives the reverb (REVB) and its ambience loop
(SNDR, 2D); switching spaces stops the old loop the way it loops and starts the new one. The
reverb is a convolver with an impulse response built from the I3DL2 parameters (decay, HF
decay ratio at the HF reference, room and room HF level, reflections and reverb level and
delay; `reverb.ts`): XAudio2's own algorithm is not documented, so this is an approximation
(TODO(M13): compare with the game). Spaces without reverb (DefaultReverb, −100 dB) have none.

# Scripting

The game's Papyrus scripts run in our own virtual machine (`src/scripting/`): the compiled
scripts (PEX, [formats/pex.md](formats/pex.md)) from the game data, attached to forms, quests,
aliases and dialogue by the plugins (VMAD, [formats/esm.md](formats/esm.md)). Milestone M8.

## The game's scripts

`node tools/pex-dump.ts --verify` parses every script of the load order. Vanilla (with the
three DLCs and the free Creation Club items) holds 14302 compiled scripts, fragment scripts
included. 44 of them declare the 686 native functions the engine provides (Actor 184,
ObjectReference 121, Game 80, Debug 29, ActiveMagicEffect 25, Faction 24, Quest 24, Utility
24, Form 22, Alias 19, ...); 540 of those are called somewhere. The events the scripts handle
most: OnActivate, OnTriggerEnter, OnDeath, OnLoad, OnUpdate, OnEffectStart, OnHit, OnInit,
OnContainerChanged, OnCellAttach.

## Threads

As the Creation Kit wiki's "Threading Notes (Papyrus)" describe them (`papyrus-vm.ts`):

- Every event an object gets runs on a thread of its own, one per script attached to it,
  in the handler of the state the script is in when the event comes.
- A script instance is locked while a thread runs in it. Any **external call** unlocks it until
  the call returns: a function on another object, a global function, another object's native,
  a latent function (Utility.Wait). Calls on self keep the lock. Threads waiting for the lock
  get in in the order they came (the game's order is not guaranteed).
- Until a script's **OnInit** has finished, its other events and other scripts' calls and
  property access wait for it (calls from inside another OnInit do not).
- **Latent** natives suspend their thread (`NativeCall.latent`), unlocking its script also
  for natives on self, until what they wait for has happened. Quest.SetStage waits so for the
  stage's fragments, each on a thread of its own (the wiki warns that setting a stage in
  OnInit can deadlock: the fragment waits for the OnInit that waits for it); the scheduler (`scheduler.ts`) resumes waits on its clocks: real seconds outside
  menus (Utility.Wait) and game time (WaitGameTime).
- Each frame, threads run for the [Papyrus] **fUpdateBudgetMS** budget (1.2 ms); a thread
  past it goes on in the next frame, keeping its lock. Without frames (Node tools) threads
  run straight through, and one that runs two million instructions without ever waiting is
  stopped as an endless loop.
- A script error (a runaway thread, too deep a call stack) stops its thread and is reported,
  never thrown at the engine, as the game logs it.

TODO(M12): save the threads, variables and registrations.
